## Usage

We are supporting two kind of entities to get updates: a thread or a comment.

- Use a link: `/watch https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41284703`
- Use a ID: `/watch 41277014`
- Watch for a comment: `/watch https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41286459`

## Features

- You will receive updates on all threads or comments if there have been any changes within the scheduled time. The default schedule policy backs off for `30 * 60 + attempts ^ 4 * (1 + rand(Â±10%)) * 60` seconds, with the maximum number of attempts set to 10 by default. This results in exactly 10 scheduled checks.
